Security Posture
================

There are multiple avenues to secure a Compute Endpoint installation.
Administrators familiar with `Globus Connect Server`_ will recognize the
concepts of identity mapping and authentication policies to limit access to
resources.  (Notably, Globus Compute also implements the :ref:`High-Assurance
<posture-ha>` aspect of Globus Auth policies.)  But more specifically for
Compute, there is also the possibility to limit exactly which functions may be
invoked, and how arguments may be serialized.

Each of these concepts is outlined below.


.. _identity-mapping:

Identity Mapping
----------------

The current security model of the Multi-User Compute Endpoint (i.e., running as
the ``root`` user) relies heavily upon Identity Mapping and POSIX user support.
The only job of an endpoint is to start user endpoint processes for users on
request from the Globus Compute web service.  The actual processing of tasks is
left to the individual user endpoint processes.  This is accomplished through
the well-known ``fork()`` |rarr| *drop privileges* |rarr| ``exec()`` Unix
workflow, mimicking the approach of many other services (including Secure Shell
[ssh], Globus GridFTP, and the Apache Web server).  In this manner, all of the
standard Unix administrative user controls can be enforced.

"Mapping an identity" is the site-specific process of verifying that one
identity is equivalent to another for the purposes of a given action.  In the
Globus Compute case, this means translating a Globus Auth identity set to a
local POSIX user account on the endpoint host for each request to start a user
endpoint process.  For a multi-user endpoint, an identity mapping configuration
is required, and is the main difference from a :doc:`non-root endpoint
<endpoints>` |nbsp| --- |nbsp| a ``root``-owned multi-user endpoint first maps
the Globus Auth identity set from each start message to a local POSIX user
(i.e., a local username), before ``fork()``-ing a new process, dropping
privileges to that user, and starting the requested user endpoint process.

See :ref:`Multi-User ยง Configuration <example-idmap-config>` for specifics and
examples.


Authentication Policies
-----------------------

In addition to the identity mapping access control, administrators may also use
Globus authentication policies to narrow which identities can even send tasks to
a multi-user endpoint.  An authentication policy can enforce details such as
that a user has an identity from a specific domain or has authenticated with the
Globus Auth recently.  Refer to the `Authentication Policies documentation`_ for
more background and specifics on what Globus authentication policies can do and
how they fit in to a site's security posture.

Reference :ref:`Authentication Policies <auth-policies>` for more information.


Function Allow Listing
----------------------

Administrators can narrow endpoint usage by limiting what functions may be
requested by tasks.  The web-service will reject any submissions that request
functions not in the endpoint's configured ``allowed_functions`` list, and user
endpoint processes will again verify each task against the same list |nbsp| ---
|nbsp| a check at the web-service and a check on-site.

Please reference :ref:`Function Allow Listing <function-allowlist>` for more
detailed information.


Function Argument Serialization
-------------------------------

Administrators may also fine-tune how task arguments are deserialised by user
endpoints.  While callables (such as functions) must be serialized by |dill|_
(an extension of Python's native |pickle|_ serializer), arguments to functions
may be restricted to the safer |JSONData| serializer.  This limits what
arguments functions may receive |nbsp| --- |nbsp| for example, a callable like
another function could not be passed |nbsp| --- |nbsp| but is safe from
arbitrary code execution during deserialization.

See :ref:`Restricting Submission Serialization Methods
<restrict-submission-serialization-methods>` for more information.


.. _posture-ha:

High-Assurance (HA)
-------------------

Endpoints may be designated High-Assurance (HA), which enact a couple of
behavior differences:

- audit logging is enabled, and (until configured otherwise) logs task events to
  ``audit.log`` in the endpoint directory
- enable registration of HA functions with the endpoint; HA functions may only
  run on the HA endpoint to which they were registered
- SDK uses of HA functions will similarly incur the HA policy requirements
- HA functions are cleared from all Globus-related storage (e.g., function name,
  definition, description) after 3 months of inactivity.

Reference :ref:`High-Assurance <high-assurance>` for details.


Multiple Endpoint Administrators
--------------------------------

Endpoints associated with a subscription may be administered by multiple Globus
Auth identities.  The identities are stated in the ``admins`` key of the
``config.yaml``:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: ``config.yaml``

   subscription_id: 600ba9ac-ef16-4387-30ad-60c6cc3a6853
   admins:
     # Peter Gibbons (software engineer)
     - 10afcf74-b041-4439-7e0d-eab371767440
     # Samir Nagheenanajar (sysadmin, HPC services)
     - a6a7b9ee-be04-4e45-7832-d3737c2fafa2


These administrators are in addition to the owner of the endpoint, so the
example provided would effectively have 3 administrators, each with the ability
to remotely manage and view the endpoint's status page in the `Globus Web app`_.

.. important::

   Note that changes to this list will not go into effect until the endpoint is
   restarted and registers afresh with the Globus Compute web services.
