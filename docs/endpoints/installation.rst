Installing the Compute Endpoint
*******************************

The Globus Compute Endpoint is available as a PyPI package or as a native system
package (DEB and RPM).

Operating System Support
========================

Currently, the Globus Compute Endpoint is only supported on Linux.  While some have
reported success running Compute endpoints on macOS, we do not currently support
it.  If running on a non-Linux host OS is necessary, consider doing so in a container
running Linux.

.. note::

   Though the Compute Endpoint is only supported on Linux, the
   :doc:`Globus Compute SDK <../sdk/index>` *is* supported on other operating systems.

Installing Directly via PyPI
============================

If the site administrator has not already installed the Globus Compute Endpoint
software, users typically install it from `PyPI
<https://pypi.org/project/globus-compute-endpoint/>`_.  We **strongly** recommend
installing the Globus Compute endpoint into an isolated virtual environment (e.g.,
`venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_, `virtualenv
<https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/>`_).  We recommend use of |pipx for library
isolation|_:

.. code-block:: console

   $ python3 -m pipx install globus-compute-endpoint

Repository-Based Installation
=============================

The ``globus-compute-endpoint`` project is available on PyPI, and is also available in
Globus' repositories as native DEB and RPM packages.  The repository package is
``globus-compute-agent``.

.. _compute-endpoint-pre-requisites:

Prerequisites
-------------

#. Supported Linux Distributions

   Where feasible, Globus Compute supports the `same Linux distributions as does Globus
   Connect Server`_.

#. Administrator Privileges

   Per usual semantics, installing the DEB or RPM packages will require administrative
   access on the target host.

#. TCP Ports

   * Port 443, outbound to ``compute.api.globus.org``
   * Port 443, outbound to ``compute.amqps.globus.org``

   .. note::
       We do not offer a range of specific IP addresses for firewall blocking rules.

What is Installed
-----------------

The Globus Compute Endpoint software will be installed in
``/opt/globus-compute-agent/`` and a shell-script wrapper will be installed to
``/usr/sbin/globus-compute-endpoint``.

The packages also rely on Globus' supplied Python.  As of this writing, that
is Python3.9, and is installed to ``/opt/globus-python/``.  While Globus Compute is
supported on any `Python version that is not EOL`_, the Compute agent packages are built
against Globus' Python.  As the Python version has implications for
:ref:`function and data serialization consistency <avoiding-serde-errors>`,
administrators may want to consider supporting :ref:`multiple Python versions in the
configuration template <configure-multiple-python-versions>`.

RPM Installation
----------------

.. code-block::

   # get the Globus installer
   dnf install https://downloads.globus.org/globus-connect-server/stable/installers/repo/rpm/globus-repo-latest.noarch.rpm

   # install the Globus Compute Agent package
   dnf install globus-compute-agent

DEB Installation
----------------

.. code-block::

   # get the Globus installer
   curl -LOs https://downloads.globus.org/globus-connect-server/stable/installers/repo/deb/globus-repo_latest_all.deb
   dpkg -i globus-repo_latest_all.deb

   # install the Globus Compute Agent package
   apt update
   apt install globus-compute-agent

SUSE Installation
-----------------

.. code-block::

   # install Globus' public key
   rpm --import https://downloads.globus.org/globus-connect-server/stable/installers/keys/GPG-KEY-Globus
   zypper install https://downloads.globus.org/globus-connect-server/stable/installers/repo/rpm/globus-repo-latest.noarch.rpm

   # install the Globus Compute Agent package
   zypper install globus-compute-agent
