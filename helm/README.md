# Kubernetes Endpoint Helm Chart
This chart will deploy a functioning Kubernetes endpoint into your cluster. It
will launch workers with a specified container image into a namespace.

It uses Role Based Access Control to create a service account and assign it
permissions to create the worker pod.

## How to Use
There are two required values to specify in the `values.yaml` file:
`endpointUUID` and authentication.  The `endpointUUID` is easy:

```
endpointUUID: <someuuid>
```

The UUID is of your choosing, but must be available.  In particular, if the
UUID you choose has already been taken, the endpoint will fail to register.
One method to generate a UUID is with the `uuid` command line tool:

```shell
$ sudo apt install uuid
...
$ uuid  # will generate a version 1 UUID.
e22be136-b3eb-11ed-8611-5b7bc2d2f962
```

Alternatively, Python has the builtin `uuid` module:
```python
>>> import uuid
>>> uuid.uuid4()
UUID('ea0cab7e-b3eb-11ed-ae8b-719a5541eacb')
```

Getting the authentication setup is slightly more involved.  Under the hood,
the Globus Compute Endpoint uses the Globus Compute SDK for communication with the web services,
which requires an authenticated user for most API routes.  The Globus Compute SDK can
use either client credentials or user credentials, both of which this chart
implements.  The next two sections describe how to implement each.

#### Client Credentials
The Globus Compute SDK supports use of Globus Auth Client Credentials.  In practice,
that means exporting two variables into the endpoint's environment:

* `FUNCX_SDK_CLIENT_ID`
* `FUNCX_SDK_CLIENT_SECRET`

These variables may be generated by following the steps in the [Registering an
Application](https://docs.globus.org/api/auth/developer-guide/#register-app)
section on the [Globus Auth Developer's
Guide](https://docs.globus.org/api/auth/developer-guide/).

Outside of this chart, use of client credentials is also documented for [normal
Globus Compute SDK
usage](https://funcx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sdk.html#client-credentials-with-globus-compute-clients).

Add these variables to a secret object in Kubernetes.  For example, to put them
into a Kubernetes store named `my-secrets`, you could create a temporary env file
and load them:

```
$ (umask 077; touch client_creds.env)  # create with 0600 (-rw-------) perms
$ cat > client_creds.env
FUNCX_SDK_CLIENT_ID=11111111-2222-4444-8888-000000000000
FUNCX_SDK_CLIENT_SECRET=yoursecret
^D
$ kubectl create secret generic my-secrets --from-env-file ./client_creds.env
```

Then, specify the secret name in the values file, and tell the chart to use
the client credentials:
```
secrets: my-secrets
useClientCredentials: true
```

#### User Credentials
If you have previously utilized the Globus Compute client, then jump to step 2 as you
will already have generated the credential file.

1. Instantiate a client with these two commands:
    ```shell
    $ pip install globus-compute-sdk
    $ python -c "from globus_compute_sdk import Client; Client()"
    ```
    A prompt beginning "Please authenticate with Globus here:" and with a long
    URL to a Globus authentication workflow will print to the terminal; follow
    the URL and paste the resulting token back into the terminal.  This will
    create the credential file at `$HOME/.funcx/storage.db`.
1. Create a Kubernetes secret named `compute-sdk-tokens` with this file:
    ```shell
    $ kubectl create secret generic compute-sdk-tokens --from-file=$HOME/.funcx/storage.db
    ```
    It is important to name the secret `compute-sdk-tokens` as this chart looks
    for that secret name, specifically.

With the `compute-sdk-tokens` Kubernetes secret object created, tell the chart to
use the user credentials:

```
useUserCredentials: true
```

### Install the helm chart
You need to add the Globus Compute helm chart repo to your helm

```shell script
helm repo add funcx http://funcx.org/funcx-helm-charts/ && helm repo update
```

Create a local values.yaml file to set any specific values you wish to
override. Then invoke the chart installation by specifying your custom values,
the Globus Compute helm repo to install from, and the globus-compute-endpoint chart:

```shell script
helm install -f your-values.yaml funcx funcx/funcx_endpoint
```

The notes that are printed with the installation will tell you how to access the
logs for the endpoint to see the UID. For example, to retrieve the pod name use
the following command:

```shell script
export EP_POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=globus-compute-endpoint" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
```

---
**NOTE**

Depending on your configuration, the namespace may be something other than
'default'.

---

And view the pod's status via:

```shell script
kubectl get pods $EP_POD_NAME
```

Or its logs via:

```shell script
kubectl logs $EP_POD_NAME
```
