Changed
^^^^^^^

- Removed the noisy ``/bin/false`` example identity mapping configuration; it
  was functionally useless other than to show how to configure for an
  externally-called executable during the identity mapping phase.  Opt to
  remove the potential for unnecessary noise in the logs and provide a direct
  example in the documentation instead.
