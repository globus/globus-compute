New Functionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- With this release, we are moving from the existing "Multi-User Endpoint" /
  "Single-User Endpoint" dichotomy to a unified model where every endpoint
  supports configuration templates.

Deprecated
^^^^^^^^^^

- As all endpoints are now template capable, the ``multi_user`` config option is now
  deprecated.

Changed
^^^^^^^

- When configuring an endpoint, the command line automatically decides whether to
  initialize identity mapping based on whether or not the running user is privileged.
  This can be overridden with the ``--multi-user`` flag -- set to ``true`` to force
  multi-user support, or ``false`` to disable it.  (Note that the running user must
  still be privileged for multi-user support.)
